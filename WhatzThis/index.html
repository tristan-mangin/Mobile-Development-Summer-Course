        <p>
            WhatzThis has different colored lights. They change when you press 
            the buttons.

        <h2>Chapter 3: "Auto Mode"</h2>
        <p>
            WhatzThis has an automatic mode that's useful for those times when 
            you're doing something else, such as dancing, but would still like 
            to have changing colors on your device. <br><br>
